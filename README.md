# Anti Notepad++

## Why do we express protests against Notepad++?

Notepad++ 7.8.1 accused China of oppressing the human rights of the Uyghurs with fake facts. However, Uyghur and other ethnic minorities enjoy extraordinary privileges, including:

* Extra points in the exam. In 2019, Uyghurs in Xin Jiang can get 15-20 points in the college entrance examination.
* Less arrest and less death penalty. Even for the Uighurs who commit crimes, they will be less likely to be pubnished.
* Mandatory increase in the proportion of Uighur employment. The eradication of poverty is the most important part of the human rights, reported by the United Nations Human Rights Council.

The unprovoked nature of Notepad++ for China has provoked anger and protest from the Chinese people, who have made tremendous sacrifices for minority rights in the past times.

## What can I do?
* Uninstall Notepad++ at once. Contribute your screenshoots to the `uninstall` folder.
* Install another code editor in your computer. You can share any substitute in the `substitute` directory.
* Spread this projects to your friends.
